v0.16.0
=======
This minor release primarily introduces the :class:`.Plugfigurable` class type,
which is a very simple type that combines the existing :class:`.Pluggable` and
:class:`.Configurable` types that are commonly utilized together.


Updates / New Features
----------------------

Interfaces

* Added a new :class:`~.smqtk_core.Plugfigurable` class that provides a
  convenient handle to inherit from both :class:`.Pluggable` and
  :class:`.Configurable` at the same time.

CI

* Updated gitlab CI rules to trigger the test jobs during merge requests, tag
  builds and branch pipelines when the branch in question is the default branch
  (i.e. master).

* Added python 3.9 to the gitlab matrix of versions tested. Added 3.9 to the
  ``setup.py`` metadata.

* Updated requirements versions to the latest for each package.


Fixes
-----

Docs

* Minor fixes to the ``sphinx_server.py`` helper tool: Removed a watch to a
  directory that does not exist.

Misc.

* Fixed ``MANIFEST.in`` file to not include a no-longer-present file and to
  include all ``requirements/*.txt`` files.

* Removed unnecessary ``.dockerignore`` file.
