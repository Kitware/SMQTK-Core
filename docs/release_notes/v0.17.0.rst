v0.17.0
=======


Updates / New Features
----------------------

Pluggable

* Removed `__init__` method and added a `__new__` in its place. The behavior is
  the same, but is now less fragile from override and addresses some issues
  with type-checking during some multiple inheritance situations.

Misc.

* Now standardize to using `Poetry`_ for environment/build/publish management.

  * Collapsed pytest configuration into the :file:`pyproject.toml` file.

  * Updated release process documentation to reflect the use of Poetry.

* Add explicit ReadTheDocs configuration file :file:`.readthedocs.yaml`.


Fixes
-----

CI

* Update CI configurations to use `Poetry`_.

Docs

* Fix incorrect filepath relative to this repository in the release process
  documentation.

* Fix for use with poetry where appropriate.
